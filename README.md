When talking about .NET development, it's important to understand the difference between, .NET, CLR(Common Language Runtime), and C#

- CLR:(This is the crucial component of.NET ecosystem)
Itâ€™s the execution environment for all .NET programs
Manage memory allocation and deallocation(garbage collection)
Ensure type safety and security 
Handle exception management 
All .NET languages are compiled into Intermediate Language(IL), which the CLR then executes. 
 
- C# is the primary language used in .NET
OOP
Syntax similar to C-style language(C++, Java)
Continually evolving 

- .NET supports multiple languages even if C# is the most popular:
VB.NET(OOP of vision basic)
F#  a functional-first programming language

- NuGet
Package manager for .NET
Allow developers  to share and consume libraries 
Simplifies dependency management in .NET projects

- Blazor:
